Find-Me-A-Drink is a simple web application that uses an image recognition API (clarifai.com) to provide suggestions
on what drink to have with the type of food you provided be it an uploaded image, a link to an image or query.

It's really simple and does exactly what it's meant to do. It might sound funny, but haven't you every been in a situation where you don't
know what to drink with the food you're eating?
